# About Butchy 
<br><br>

<br><br>  
Well lets see, I have over 20 years in IT industry from desktop/help desk support to network administrator to programmer and solution architect but I am relatively new to Information Security. I never limited myself to a single stream of ICT, I have enjoyed and I welcome the opportunity and the challenge that solution architecture, software development and my solid foundation of network administration and infrastructure has to offer.
<br><br>
### My Career Goal:
To complete my masters degree, gain my OSCP and maybe to work in the Security/Defence Sector or for an Open Source, innovating or leading edge company with a focus on Information Security. 
<br><br>
What can I say, I enjoy building proof of concepts where I can mix and match several different technologies together in ways no one has done before and try and break them....oh and of course fix them too!... I'm a problem solver!
