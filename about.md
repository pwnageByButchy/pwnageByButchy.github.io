# About Butchy 

![img]({{ '/assets/images/butchy.png' | relative_url }}){: .center-image }
 

I have over 20 years in IT industry from desktop/help desk support to network administrator to programmer and solution architect. I never limited myself to a single stream of ICT, I have enjoyed and welcome the opportunity and the challenge that solution architecture, software development and my solid foundation of network administration and infrastructure has to offer.

If you are looking for that ICT professional that can be given a new technology and without using before can design or develop a solution to fix your customers problem then you seriously need to see my CV!... I'm a problem solver!

### My Career Goal:
To complete my degree, gain my OSCP and to work in the Security/Defence Sector or for an Open Source, innovating or leading edge company with a focus on Information Security. What can I say, I enjoy building proof of concepts where I can mix and match several different technologies together in ways no one has done before and try and break them....oh and of course fix them too!
