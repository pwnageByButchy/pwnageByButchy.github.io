A Python3 script to create and maintain a “Golden Image” of VMs in VMWare Workstation (for the moment) on either a Windows or Linux host...

This saves deleting the VM, downloading the VM and then updating it, download all the Git repos, download your git repos (or committing them so you don't loose code) everytime time you mess up a VM or in the case of Pentesters when you start work on a new job start fresh but updated!

With GoldenSnapshoter your VMs, have your Git repos have a commit done (so you don't loose your code), they are then reset to your current golden image, the guest OS is updated, yours and third party Git repos are updated/downloaded and then that is saved as your new "Golden Image".
