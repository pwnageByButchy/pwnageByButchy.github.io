Calling All Newbies,

We are organising another weekly study / learning sessions for us noobs, that are asking the question...Where do I start?...Well right here!

On Monday the 27th April of 2020 we will start a new “Study Sessions with Butchy”, this time focusing on the Cyber Mentor’s Udemy course “Practical Ethical Hacking – The Complete Course” as our reference material.

You will need to purchase this course, we advise, following the Cyber Mentor on twitter as he puts up discount codes often to his course making it very affordable.

This is not instructor lead course, just fellow newbies (or experienced people) working through things together and helping each other out. This will be online through a Slack Workspace but feel free to get together in groups, in your various cities if that helps but I will leave it to you to organise your own groups.

Each week we will go through various section from the Cyber Mentor’s course from setting up your lab to information gathering to post exploitation. We will follow this course working through the sectionstogether going through the various techniques. However you can also study at your own place and hopefully some kind hearted person will help you out.

Now this is self-paced but I am hoping that anyone who can speed through it make themselves available to someone who is having troubles. Along the way we can discuss resources and references that are useful. Also when we get closer to finishing the text, discuss how we would like to go forward ie. A different text or an online resource etc.

Need Resources:
1. A PC/Laptop (capable of running Virtualisation Software)
2. VMWare Workstation Player (Free) – https://www.vmware.com/go/getplayer-win
3. A Kali Linux VM - https://www.kali.org/downloads/
