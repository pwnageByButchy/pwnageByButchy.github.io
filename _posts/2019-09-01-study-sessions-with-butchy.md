Calling All Newbies,

I am organise a weekly study / learning sessions for us Newbies that are asking the question...Where do I start?...Well right here!

This is not instructor lead course, just fellow newbies working through things together and helping each other out. This will be online (aiming for either Wednesday or Thursday evenings 7-9pm Adelaide time) but feel free to get together into groups, in your various cities but I will leave it to you to organise your own groups.

Each week we will go through various chapters from Georgia Weidman's "Penetration Testing - A Hands On Introduction To Hacking" from setting up your lab to information gathering to post exploitation. 

We will follow this book as a guide working through the chapters together and once a month work through maybe do a CTF together, going through the various techniques and applying them to the steps of a Penetration Test.

1. Intelligence Gathering
2. Vulnerability Analysis
3. Exploitation
4. Post Exploitation
5. Reporting

*There are others Scoping, Threat Modelling for example but we will concentrate on the technical more than the business side. Unless we want to cover those as well, however they are not covered in the text and the topics will need to be researched.*

Now this is self-paced but I am hoping that anyone who can speed through it make themselves available to someone who is having troubles. Along the way we can discuss resources and references that are useful. 

Also when we get closer to finishing the text, discuss how we would like to go forward. ie. A different text or an online resource etc.

Needed Resources:
1. A PC/Laptop (capable of running Virtualisation Software)
2. VMWare Workstation Player (Free) – Windows Download Link 
3. A Kali Linux VM - [https://www.kali.org/downloads/](https://www.kali.org/downloads/)
4. Georgia Weidman’s “Penetration Testing – A Hands On Introduction to Hacking”
5. An Internet Connection
