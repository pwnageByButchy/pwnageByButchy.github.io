So In April, more works on the Golden Snapshoter to continue, soon I am hoping to have something out in test in the next month or so.
<br />

So In May, a hardware project using ready made electronics (meaning no soldering) was thinking sometype of security cameras using things like a Raspberry Pi or Arduino. I suspect more likely a Raspberry Pi in order to keep to the "No Soldering" aspect. Feeding these streams into sometype of Controller (thinking VM or a Rasbperry Pi 3) and recording the feed in hour long segments.
<br />

So In June, looking to expand on the project from May and looking at determining Motion Detection on the Controllers feed and then sending alerts. I have seen projects where Pi Zeros have this but they all look to slow and clunky.
